      <h1>Terms of Use — Haptic Counter</h1>
      <p class="text-muted">Last updated: 17 November 2025</p>

      <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
      <p>
        By installing or using Haptic Counter you agree to these Terms of Use. If you do not agree,
        uninstall the app and discontinue use immediately.
      </p>

      <h2>2. Eligibility</h2>
      <p>
        You must be at least 13 years old, or the minimum age required in your jurisdiction, to use
        Haptic Counter. By using the app you confirm that you meet this requirement and that you are
        legally capable of entering into this agreement.
      </p>

      <h2>3. License</h2>
      <p>
        We grant you a limited, non-exclusive, non-transferable, revocable license to install and use
        the app on your personal devices for non-commercial purposes. You may not copy, modify,
        distribute, sell, lease, reverse engineer, extract source code, or otherwise tamper with the
        app except where permitted by law.
      </p>

      <h2>4. User Responsibilities</h2>
      <p>
        You are responsible for maintaining the security of your device and any backups, and for using
        the app in compliance with local laws and these Terms. You agree not to interfere with or
        disrupt the app, attempt automated manipulation of counters or milestones, upload malicious
        audio, or infringe intellectual property rights.
      </p>
      <p>
        Haptic Counter is available globally without discrimination or geo-blocking within the
        European Union, in accordance with Regulation (EU) 2018/302.
      </p>

      <h2>5. Advertising and third-party services</h2>
      <p>
        The app displays banner ads on key screens and an interstitial at appropriate moments (for
        example after reaching milestones) via Google AdMob. Advertisers may collect device
        identifiers (such as the Android Advertising ID and, on iOS, Apple's Identifier for
        Advertisers (IDFA)) to deliver, cap, and measure ads and, when you allow tracking, personalize
        them according to your platform settings.
      </p>
      <p>
        On iOS, the app may show Apple's App Tracking Transparency (ATT) prompt; your choice controls
        whether IDFA can be used for cross-app tracking.
      </p>
      <p>For more information about Google AdMob's data practices, see:</p>

      </ul>

      <h2>6. In-app content</h2>
      <p>
        All texts, audio loops, interface elements, icon configurations, and other materials remain the
        property of Haptic Counter or their respective owners. You may not reuse our branding or
        assets without written permission.
      </p>

      <h2>7. Updates and availability</h2>
      <p>
        We may release updates, bug fixes, visual refinements, or new features (for example enhanced
        audio packs or new haptic behaviours). We are not obligated to provide ongoing support and may
        modify, suspend, or discontinue the app at any time without notice.
      </p>

      <h2>8. Data and privacy</h2>
      <p>
        Your use of the app is also governed by the Haptic Counter Privacy Policy, which explains how
        we handle information, ads, permissions, and optional exports. The policy is available from
        the app and on our website.
      </p>

      <h2>9. Disclaimer of warranties</h2>
      <p>
        Haptic Counter is provided on an "as is" and "as available" basis without warranties of any
        kind, including implied warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose,
        non-infringement, accuracy, or uninterrupted availability.
      </p>

      <h2>10. Limitation of liability</h2>
      <p>
        To the fullest extent permitted by law, we are not liable for indirect, incidental, special,
        consequential, exemplary, or punitive damages, loss of data (including exported backups), loss
        of goodwill, or other intangible losses resulting from your use of the app.
      </p>

      <h2>11. Indemnification</h2>
      <p>
        You agree to indemnify and hold harmless Haptic Counter, its maintainers, and its affiliates
        from any claims, damages, liabilities, losses, or expenses (including legal fees) arising out
        of your use of the app, violation of these Terms, or misuse of exported data.
      </p>

      <h2>12. Governing law</h2>
      <p>
        These Terms are governed by the laws of your jurisdiction. You agree to submit to the
        applicable local courts for dispute resolution, unless mandatory law requires a different
        forum.
      </p>

      <h2>13. Changes to these Terms</h2>
      <p>
        We may update these Terms from time to time. When we do, we will revise the effective date
        above. Continued use of the app after updates constitutes acceptance of the revised Terms.
      </p>
