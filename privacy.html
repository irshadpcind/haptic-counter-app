      <h1>Privacy Policy — Haptic Counter</h1>
      <p class="text-muted">Last updated: 17 November 2025</p>

      <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
      <p>
        Haptic Counter is an offline dhikr counter for Android and iOS that combines haptic feedback,
        custom milestones, animated number transitions, and optional audio loops. This Privacy Policy
        explains what information stays on your device, how ads are delivered (including Apples App
        Tracking Transparency on iOS), and the limited moments when data may leave your phone.
      </p>

      <h2>2. Information we collect</h2>
      <p>
        Haptic Counter itself does not collect, store, or share personally identifiable data. There is
        no account system and we never ask for your name, email address, or phone number.
      </p>
      <p>
        All counting sessions, milestones, streaks, audio presets, custom targets, and usage history
        remain on your device inside a local SQLite database managed by the app.
      </p>
      <p>
        Data only leaves your device if you choose to export a backup file, import a previously
        exported file, or share a session summary from the app.
      </p>
      <p>
        Third-party ad providers such as Google AdMob may receive device identifiers and coarse
        information about your device or network in order to show, cap, and measure ads as described
        below.
      </p>

      <h2>3. Ads and third-party services</h2>
      <p>
        The app displays banner ads on key screens and an interstitial at appropriate moments (for
        example after reaching milestones). Ads are served by Google AdMob and never appear while
        active counting or audio playback is in progress.
      </p>
      <p>
        On Android, AdMob may access your devices Advertising ID or similar identifiers to deliver,
        cap, and measure ads. On iOS, AdMob may use Apples Identifier for Advertisers (IDFA) when
        you grant tracking permission through Apples App Tracking Transparency (ATT) prompt. If you
        decline tracking, ads may still appear but will be less personalized.
      </p>
      <p>
        Ad rendering happens through Googles SDK; no additional analytics, attribution, or crash
        reporting SDKs are bundled with the app.
      </p>
      <p>For more information about Googles data practices, please see:</p>

          </a>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>You can also manage platform-level ad and tracking preferences from your devices system settings.</p>

      <h2>4. Local storage</h2>
      <p>
        All app data  counters, goals, audio preferences, progressive haptic streaks, and session
        history  is stored only on your device.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you uninstall the app, the local database is deleted and cannot be recovered unless you
        imported a backup beforehand.
      </p>
      <p>
        You may create optional backups using the built-in export feature. Exported files remain under
        your control until you manually share or import them again.
      </p>

      <h2>5. Permissions used</h2>
      <p>The app may request the following permissions and system capabilities:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>VIBRATE</strong>  to provide haptic feedback while counting.</li>
        <li><strong>WAKE_LOCK</strong>  to keep the screen on during counting if enabled.</li>
        <li><strong>FOREGROUND_SERVICE</strong>  to allow background audio playback.</li>
        <li>
          <strong>AD_ID (Android)</strong>  required by AdMob on Android for ad delivery, frequency
          capping, and (when allowed) personalized ads.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>ATT / IDFA (iOS)</strong>  used by iOS to ask whether you allow cross-app tracking
          for ads. You can decline and still use the app.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Photo Library / Files (iOS)</strong>  only when you choose to import or export
          backups or audio. The app never scans your entire library.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Microphone (iOS)</strong>  declared by some audio libraries; the current version
          does not record or upload your voice.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        On both Android and iOS, the app does not access your files, photos, location, contacts, or
        microphone automatically. Access is only requested when you explicitly choose actions such as
        importing or exporting a backup file or selecting an audio file through the system file or
        photo picker.
      </p>
      <p>
        On Android 13 and later, you control notification permission. Haptic Counter does not request
        or use it because the experience is offline and self-contained.
      </p>
      <p>
        Haptic Counter is available globally without discrimination or geo-blocking within the
        European Union, in accordance with Regulation (EU) 2018/302.
      </p>

      <h2>6. Childrens privacy</h2>
      <p>
        Haptic Counter is suitable for general audiences but is not directed specifically at children.
        We do not knowingly collect data from children.
      </p>

      <h2>7. Security</h2>
      <p>
        Because all data remains on your device, there is minimal risk of remote exposure. We do not
        transmit session data to any server.
      </p>
      <p>
        We recommend protecting your device with a passcode or biometrics and keeping exported backups
        only in trusted storage locations.
      </p>

      <h2>8. Policy updates</h2>
      <p>
        We may update this policy when we add features such as enhanced audio packs, new presets,
        accessibility improvements, or new ad formats.
      </p>
      <p>
        When we publish an update, the revision date above will change and the new policy will appear
        inside the app.
      </p>
